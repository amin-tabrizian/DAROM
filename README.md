# DAROM: Delay-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging

**DAROM** (Delay-Aware Reinforcement learning for On-ramp Merging) is a framework for autonomous highway on-ramp merging under stochastic V2I communication latency. The agent is modeled as a Random Delay Markov Decision Process (RDMDP) and trained with a Delay-Aware Encoder that jointly processes delayed observations, masked action histories, and delay magnitudes to recover the true latent traffic state.

## Overview

In RSU-assisted autonomous driving, the roadside unit (RSU) perceives surrounding vehicles and transmits state estimates to the ego vehicle over V2I links. Processing and transmission introduce stochastic delays, violating the Markov assumption and degrading standard RL performance. DAROM addresses this by:

- **RDMDP formulation**: Models the problem as a Random Delay MDP via state augmentation with the delayed observation, action buffer, and delay magnitude.
- **Delay-Aware Encoder**: A GRU-based encoder that implicitly infers the current latent state from the augmented input.
- **Physics-Based Safety Controller**: A supervisory layer that enforces kinematic stopping distance constraints, overriding unsafe actions before execution.
- **Unified SAC Agent**: A single soft actor-critic agent for joint longitudinal and lateral control.

Experiments in SUMO using real-world NGSIM traffic data show DAROM-GRU achieves **>99% success** in high-density traffic with random delays up to 2.0 seconds. The trained policy generalizes across five stochastic delay distributions (uniform, bimodal, bursty, triangular, exponential) without retraining.

## Installation

**Requirements**: Python 3.10+, [SUMO](https://sumo.dlr.de/) ≥ 1.18

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DAROM.git
cd DAROM

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set SUMO_HOME (add to ~/.bashrc for persistence)
export SUMO_HOME=/usr/share/sumo
```

## Training

Train DAROM-GRU from scratch:

```bash
python train_sac_delay.py \
    --delay_mode uniform \
    --encoder_mode GRU \
    --run_name GRU-uniform-delay \
    --save_dir models/GRU-uniform-delay
```

**Key arguments:**

| Argument | Options | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--delay_mode` | `uniform`, `bimodal`, `bursty`, `triangular`, `exponential` | Delay distribution during training |
| `--encoder_mode` | `GRU`, `MLP`, `Transformer` | Delay-Aware Encoder architecture |
| `--run_name` | string | WandB run name |
| `--save_dir` | path | Directory to save model checkpoints |

## Evaluation

Evaluate the pretrained model:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=models/GRU-uniform-delay/GRU-uniform-delay_best \
DELAY_MODE=uniform \
python evaluate_sac_delay.py $MODEL_PATH
```

Set `DELAY_MODE` to any of `uniform`, `bimodal`, `bursty`, `triangular`, or `exponential` to test generalization across delay profiles.

**Output metrics**: Success rate, Collision rate, No-merge (timeout) rate, Average episode reward, Ego velocity, Acceleration, Jerk — reported as mean ± std across 3 seeds × 500 episodes.

## Pretrained Model

A pretrained DAROM-GRU checkpoint is provided in `models/GRU-uniform-delay/`. The model was trained exclusively on the uniform delay distribution and evaluated zero-shot on all five distributions.

Use `GRU-uniform-delay_best` for evaluation.

## Results
